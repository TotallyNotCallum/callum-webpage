                        <p>One of the best experiences and achievements is acquiring my company SyteSpace. Myself and Adam, mentioned above, took over SyteSpace in early 2018. When acquiring the company SyteSpace was not successful at all, the previous management were running a free server scheme. Which would only bring the company to its knees. Myself & Adam when taking over the company abandoned this scheme, and created a sustainable pricing system. Since then we have expanded into offering Minecraft Hosting, Web Hosting, Discord Bot Hosting and Many other games. In 4 different locations across the globe.</p>

                        <p>One of my most notable steps in my experience is definitely my role in VictrixNetwork. I joined Victrix in early 2016, not long after I left BillCraft. When I joined Victrix it was fairly quiet with the owner at the time, Adam, development slowed down due to Adamâ€™s personal reasons. However, when I managed to get onto the Staff team and started development on the factions gamemode development started to pick up speed again, the gamemode went onto be fairly successful at release. I helped Adam and eventually got made Owner, VictrixNetwork still exists today! And is undergoing a full redevelopment as well as a rebirth.</p>
